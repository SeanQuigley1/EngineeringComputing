      <h3>Concluding Thoughts</h3>
      <p>As all the visualizations starkly demonstrated, obesity has become a widespread and pressing issue facing our society in the past two decades. Factors such as age, sex, and most significantly, income and poverty, play roles in one's proneness to becoming obese. As a society, an increase in access and affordability healthier food and activity options is necessary. A cultural and societal shift of this magnitude would greatly benefit the healthcare system, reducing the stress on medical facilities. Additionally, an increase in the number of healthy Americans would have other substantial benefits such as improving mental health across the country. It is also important to note that we do not stand for bigotry in regards to perceived physical fitness. We made this project to illuminate an issue and hopefully encourage others, but we do want to emphasize that everyone should be treated with dignity and respect.</p>
