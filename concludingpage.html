      <h3>Concluding Thoughts</h3>
      <p>As all the visualizations starkly demonstrate, obesity has become a widespread and pressing issue facing our society in recent years. Factors such as age, sex, poverty & income, and nutritional habits, play significant roles in one's proneness to health issues and obesity. As a society, an increase in access and affordability of healthier foods and physical activities is necessary. A cultural and societal shift of this magnitude would greatly benefit the healthcare system as well, reducing the stress on medical facilities and resources. Additionally, an increase in the number of healthy Americans would have other substantial benefits such as improving the mental health epidemic. It is also important to note that we do not stand for bigotry in regards to perceived physical fitness. We made this project to illuminate an issue and hopefully encourage others to consider how to incorporate healthy habits into their lives, but we do want to emphasize that everyone should be treated with dignity and respect.</p>
